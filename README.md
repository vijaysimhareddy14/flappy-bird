# Flappy Bird Clone

Simple HTML/CSS/JS game inspired by Flappy Bird. Includes sound, images (generated via canvas), animation, and restart button.

## Local Development

1. Clone or open the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve with `npx serve`).

## Deploying to Vercel

This is a static site. To deploy:

1. Install Vercel CLI (`npm i -g vercel`) or use the web UI (https://vercel.com).
2. From the project directory run:

   ```sh
   vercel
   ```

   Accept the defaults; it will upload the files and give you a URL.

No build step is necessary; `vercel.json` is provided for proper routing.
